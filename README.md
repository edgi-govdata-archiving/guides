# Guides

A place to coordinate the creation of guides to identify & document best practices we can implement now to make our work future-proof.

Topics these guides will cover include:

- How data sources (i.e., federal agencies) can make stuff easier to back up
- How to produce the hash for a dataset
- How to publish a copy of a dataset
- How to represent associations between datasets that have been downloaded

This motivation for this work came out of the Next Steps track at DataRescueNYC on Feb 3-4, you can read [a report](https://hackmd.io/MYEwRgHAhloLQHYDMAWAZnFKCs24E4kBGEOCAU3AiWCLDSQDYg==?view) of the conversation
