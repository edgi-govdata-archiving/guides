# Contributing Guidelines

We love improvements to our tools! EDGI has general [guidelines for contributing](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/overview/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to all of our organizational repos.

## Writing Guides

1. Requests for guides are handled through this repository's [issue tracker](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/guides/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aguide) and tagged with `guide`. Ideas are welcome!

  - If submitting an idea for a guide you will be prompted to add enough detail for someone else to begin research
  - Guides that have a full description and are 'ready for work' have a `ready-for-work` tag

2. To begin to on a guide, _claim the issue_ by Assigning yourself under **Assignees** in the right sidebar. You have to be added to the github organization to do this. If you are not, follow the [instructions in our overview](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/overview#get-involved) to request access.

3. Write the guide! Each guide should:
  - Use our [template](./guide-template.md), it is **critical to include the [YAML front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/)** because we use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to create a website for our guides.
  - Be written in `markdown`, preferably using [hackmd.io/](https://hackmd.io/), as it is linked to github accounts and supports collaborative work

4. Follow our general [guidelines for contributing](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/overview/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to submit a Pull Request with your guide!
